title: Exploit methodology, not just machines
description: Somewhere between initial reconnaissance and root access.

Somewhere between initial reconnaissance and root access, there’s a process — one built on enumeration, analysis, exploitation, and persistence.

This blog documents that process through detailed CTF writeups and technical breakdowns. Each post focuses on methodology over shortcuts, understanding over copy-paste, and learning over luck.

Expect structured walkthroughs, privilege escalation techniques, web exploitation notes, and practical lessons extracted from real lab environments.

Break the logic. Understand the vulnerability. Own the system (ethically).
